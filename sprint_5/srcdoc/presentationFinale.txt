OPTI project have been executed according to the "MPA" module's program, as a second year of DUT Informatique work, at the IUT of Blagnac. The aim of the project have been the creation of an application providing to make easier the management of the tutored projects of the IUT. The process of developpement used to follow the sprint-based projects management method "Agile". We have worked for about 60 hours on that project.

== 1B2 group's OPTI : a halftone success

The weft of the project has issued severals perturbations, due to a lot of software architecture problems and comunication problems. Consequently, we are not able to deliver an application respecting the whole product backlog. The last runnable application has been released on sprint 2. Then, our work weren't enough to complete the backlog.
However, our sprint 2 OPTI is well working. It provides differents functionalities to the user, as detailled in the next part. The main missing point was the cross-view of the data.

=== The unfinished OPTI

==== Year's tutored projects list of topics

-  Create/Delete/Alter a topic

==== Student teams' wishes

-  Define a students team
-  Associate students to a team

==== Associate projects to student teams

-  Define a topic for a team
-  List (un)affected projects
-  List (un)affected teams

==== Teachers association to distinct projects

-  Define the teatchers for a tutored project

==== Other features

The other features of the backlog weren't ready at the end of the sprint 2. Unfortunately, and despite our hard work during the other sprints, we didn't produced an other well-working version. Details about programming problems will be explained later.

=== OPTI Web's success

In spite of the unfinished version o OPTI, we did produced a fully-usable OPTI Web application. All the product's backlog is respected.

== A cost accordingly-based on our working time

As an estimation of the amout of money our work may have cost to a company, we tought that the salary of each member of the team was about 35,00€ an hour, including all the taxes on work. Considerating that we worked 55 hours on the project, and that we were six, the cost for a corporation would be :

6*35,00*50 = 11.550€

Off course, that value doesn't include the cost of the energy consumed by the computers and the lights, or any charges linked to the material buys, or even any miscalenious charges that a real company would have.
